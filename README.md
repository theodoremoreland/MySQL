A series of SQL queries on the MySQL Sakila sample database.

The queries demonstrate views, joins, subqueries, ordering, grouping, where clauses, limit clauses, pattern matching, aliasing, builtin functions, and CRUD operations.

The queries were for a homework assignment at Washignton University's Data Analytics Boot Camp (2019).
